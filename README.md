# WIne-Quality-Prediction
I performed a comprehensive analysis on a wine quality dataset, employing statistical measures and Seaborn visualizations to conduct thorough exploratory data analysis. Subsequently, I transitioned into machine learning model development, where I constructed a Random Forest Classifier to predict wine quality. The model demonstrated its efficacy by achieving high accuracy on the test dataset. As part of the data preprocessing and feature engineering phase, I meticulously prepared the dataset by handling missing values, separated features and labels, and conducted essential feature engineering steps to optimize the data for subsequent model training. This dual approach, combining insightful data analysis with robust machine learning model development and preprocessing, reflects my proficiency in deriving valuable insights from data and implementing effective predictive models.
